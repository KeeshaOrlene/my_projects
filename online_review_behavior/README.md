 **Year:** 2024  
**Author:** Keesha OrlÃ¨ne Ngombo Mouelet  
**Project:** Amazon Consumer Behavior Study (Bayesian Modeling)

## Overview
This research explores how Amazon shoppers perceive the importance of **customer reviews** when making purchase decisions. Using a Bayesian ordinal logistic regression model, it investigates how behaviors like **browsing frequency**, **purchase frequency**, and **age** influence the **importance assigned to reviews**.

## Dataset Summary
- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Amazon Consumer Behavior](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset)
- 602 survey responses, 23 variables  
- Target variable: `Customer_Reviews_Importance` (ordinal: 1â€“5 scale)  
- Key predictors: `Age`, `Purchase_Frequency`, `Browsing_Frequency`

##  Methodology

**Model Used:**  
Bayesian **Ordinal Logistic Regression** using the `brms` package in R (built on Stan).

**Key Steps:**
- Preprocessed categorical predictors to numeric scales
- Applied **informative and weakly-informative priors**
- Ensured model assumptions:
  - Ordinal response
  - No multicollinearity
  - Proportional odds assumption

**Priors:**  
Based on *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* (Kruschke), using default weakly informative priors where needed.

**Diagnostics:**
- Posterior predictive checks  
- Interaction effects explored  
- Sensitivity analysis under alternative priors

## Key Insights

- Younger users and those who browse/purchase more frequently tend to rate reviews as more important
- Behavioral variables (not just demographics) are strong predictors of reliance on reviews
- Predictive distribution provides a framework for understanding future consumer decision-making under uncertainty

## Overview

This study investigates whether different music genres and the timing of music during exams impact students' exam scores and completion time. Conducted on graduate students, the experiment compares performance across three music genres: classical, Metal, and White Noise (control), played either at the beginning or middle of the test.

## Research Question

> Does music genre affect graduate students' discerning capabilities (exam performance and completion time)?

---

## Experimental Design

**Design Type:** Randomized Complete Block Design  
**Sample Size:** 18 students (blocked by day of week: Mon, Tues, Wed)  
**Response Variables:**
- Exam Score  
- Completion Time

**Explanatory Variables:**
- Music Genre (Classical, Metal, White Noise)  
- Start Time of Music (Beginning or Mid-test)  

**Covariates:**
- Music Preference  
- Age  
- Day of the Week (Block)

**Fixed Conditions:** Room, noise, and temperature held constant in a library testing room.

## Tools & Analysis

- **RStudio** and **Minitab** used for:
  - Sample size simulation  
  - Descriptive stats  
  - General Linear Model (GLM) fitting  
  - Assumption checks: Ryan Joiner, Levene’s Test  
  - Post-hoc comparisons: Tukey’s method

---

## Key Findings

- No significant effect of music genre or start time on **exam scores**  
- A **marginal effect** on **completion time**, with **metal music slightly delaying performance**
- Classical and white noise led to faster test completions, suggesting potential cognitive benefits in task duration

**Conclusion:**  
While music may not impact scores, but it affects how long students complete tasks. Future work with larger samples may uncover more profound behavioral effects tied to genre and timing.

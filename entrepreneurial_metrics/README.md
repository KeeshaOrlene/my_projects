## Overview
This project analyzes entrepreneurial behavior and business performance using multivariate techniques. Drawing on a dataset of 1,000 U.S. startups, it explores how factors like **risk tolerance** and **innovation level** influence business outcomes beyond what market trends alone can explain.

---

## Research Questions
- Do entrepreneurial profiles shape business metrics?  
- Can innovation and risk-taking predict long-term outcomes?  
- Are there observable clusters among startups?

---

## Dataset Details

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Entrepreneurship Decision Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/entrepreneurship-decision-dataset)  
- **Size:** 1,000 startups awith 14 variables
- **Key Variables:**
  - `Innovation_Level` – Low, Medium, High
  - `Risk_Tolerance` – Entrepreneur's comfort with uncertainty
  - `Predicted_Market_Trend` – AI-generated outlook (e.g., Growth, Decline)
  - Multiple metrics (investment, confidence, funding, etc.)

---

## Methods Used

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Histograms, Q-Q plots  
- **MANOVA:** Tested differences in business metrics by innovation and risk groups  
- **Correspondence Analysis:** Mapped categorical relationships (e.g., innovation vs. trend)  
- **Profile Analysis:** Compared metric patterns across entrepreneur types  
- **MDS Plot:** Multidimensional scaling revealed lack of natural clustering by trend
---

## Key Findings

- **Risk Tolerance** significantly influences business patterns  
- **Innovation Level** showed marginal significance but suggests nuanced impact  
- Startups with **low innovation** were more likely to show **growth**, while **high innovation** leaned toward **stability**  
- **Retail** startups were volatile, **healthcare** was stable, and **tech** showed inconsistency

**Conclusion:** Entrepreneurial behavior — more than industry or market conditions — drives business differentiation.

## Future Work

- Enhance the dataset with more behavioral features  
- Build predictive models (e.g., logistic regression) to forecast success  
- Explore time-series data for trend evolution

💡 **Insight:**  
Building a business isn't just about metrics—it’s about mindset. The data suggest that **how entrepreneurs think and act matters more** than their sector or available resources.

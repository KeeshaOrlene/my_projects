🗂️ Urban Transit Adoption Analysis  
📅 Project Year: 2024  
👩🏽‍💻 Authors: Michael DeLetter, C. Dustin Hildenbr, and Keesha Orlène Ngombo Mouelet  

📌 Overview  
This project explores the key drivers of urban transit ridership across 120 U.S. metropolitan areas using data from the 2019 National Transit Database (NTD). By modeling **transit miles per capita**, the study challenges the assumption that population density is the dominant factor in transit adoption—pointing instead to the significance of **funding and financial investment**.

🔍 Background & Significance  
The U.S. transit landscape often ties success to density, inspired by examples like NYC. But this project demonstrates that **per capita spending** on transit, not population density, plays a more vital role in shaping urban transit outcomes. The insights offer a policy-relevant shift in how we understand and plan for mass transit in varied urban environments.

📊 Key Drivers Examined:
- Population Density  
- Transit Expenses Per Capita  
- Percentage of Public Funding  
- Fleet Size per 1,000 Residents  
- Presence of Rail Infrastructure  
- Time Zone (as a regional proxy)

💡 Research Objective  
To model which variables most significantly predict urban transit adoption, measured through transit miles per capita, and to develop a reduced, interpretable model for policy and planning use.

🛠️ Methodology  
**Data Source**: 2019 National Transit Database (NTD)  
**Preprocessing**:  
- Aggregated data by Urbanized Areas (UZA)  
- Calculated per capita and density metrics  
- Transformed variables using Box-Cox for normality  
**Modeling**:  
- Linear regression using R (`lm()`)  
- Backward elimination with `stepAIC()`  
- Diagnostic analysis and residual checking  
**Technologies Used**:  
- R (`car`, `MASS`, `alr3`)  
- Excel for data cleaning  
- Visualizations via R base plotting

📈 Modeling Results  
- 🟢 Final model retained **expenses per capita** and **percent public funding**  
- ⚠️ Density was not statistically significant  
- 🔍 Adjusted R²: **0.8878**, indicating strong model performance  
- 📉 Small negative effect of public funding percentage on ridership, possibly linked to underlying structural or political factors

📊 Feature Engineering & Transformation  
- Power-transformed skewed variables for normality  
- Converted “rail presence” to a binary feature  
- Removed highly collinear predictors (e.g., fares per capita)

⚖️ Challenges & Limitations  
- Observational data: limits on causality  
- Only included cities with populations > 300,000  
- Density may still matter in excluded smaller areas  
- Potential confounding political/regional dynamics (e.g., red vs. blue states)

🧠 Conclusion  
The project reveals that **how much is spent per person matters more than how many people live per square mile**. While density has long been viewed as key, a focus on **transit funding and spending structures** may yield more impactful transit planning outcomes.

📌 Note: The findings encourage data-driven decision-making in transit planning and challenge conventional wisdom around urban density and ridership.
